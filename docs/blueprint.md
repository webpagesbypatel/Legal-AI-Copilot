## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E5DA8) for trust, professionalism, and competence. Note: refrain from using more than one blue color; in particular, DO NOT use the shade of blue named 'Teal' (a blue-green mixture).
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean interface.
- Accent color: Black (#000000) for highlighting key insights, calls to action, and important notifications.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for headings and titles. Playfair adds a touch of elegance, fashion, and a high-end feel.

- Subtle animations with framer-motion for transitions, loading states, and user feedback without being distracting.
